descriptions = {
    "Engine": """The engine is the heart of your car. It converts fuel into power that drives your vehicle forward.
Common problems include knocking sounds, oil leaks, overheating, or loss of power.
‚ö†Ô∏è Possible causes: low oil, worn pistons, or poor fuel quality.
üß∞ Fix: Check oil level, radiator coolant, and spark plugs. If noise continues, visit a mechanic immediately.""",

    "Brake": """The braking system ensures your car can stop safely.
Squeaking or grinding noises usually mean your brake pads are worn or your rotors are damaged.
‚ö†Ô∏è Possible causes: thin brake pads, low brake fluid, or debris between pads.
üß∞ Fix: Replace brake pads, refill brake fluid, and have the brake lines checked.""",

    "Gearbox": """The gearbox transfers power from the engine to the wheels.
If you hear grinding noises or experience hard shifting, it may indicate a gearbox issue.
‚ö†Ô∏è Possible causes: low transmission fluid, worn gears, or clutch misalignment.
üß∞ Fix: Check and top up gearbox oil. Visit a professional if shifting remains rough.""",

    "Clutch": """The clutch connects and disconnects the engine and gearbox.
A burning smell or slipping during gear changes often signals clutch wear.
‚ö†Ô∏è Possible causes: worn clutch plate, weak pressure plate, or hydraulic leak.
üß∞ Fix: Avoid holding the clutch pedal halfway. Replace clutch plate if slipping continues.""",

    "Exhaust": """The exhaust system removes gases from the engine and reduces noise.
Loud exhausts or smoke can mean leaks or blockages.
‚ö†Ô∏è Possible causes: damaged muffler, cracked exhaust pipe, or dirty catalytic converter.
üß∞ Fix: Inspect for leaks under the car. Replace rusted parts to avoid engine strain.""",

    "Fan Belt": """The fan belt powers key parts like the alternator, cooling fan, and water pump.
If you hear squealing, the belt may be loose or cracked.
‚ö†Ô∏è Possible causes: worn belt, bad pulley, or misaligned tensioner.
üß∞ Fix: Check belt tension and condition. Replace if worn or frayed.""",
